# Gold Prices Data Scraping and Analysis Python

This project aims to analyze gold prices across various cities and states using data collected from the RapidAPI Gold Price API. The project spans the following key components:

# Data Collection:
We gather real-time and historic gold price data from different cities and states using the RapidAPI Gold Price API. The data is fetched through a Python script that makes API calls, retrives the data and stores it in a structured format, such as a CSV file.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
The collected data is then analyzed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. This includes calculating average gold prices by city and states, trecking monthly price trends, and identifying any significant fluctuations over the past 4 months. The analysis is performed using python libraries such as Pandas.

# Data Visualization:
To make the insights more accessible, we visualize the data through graphs and charts. We use labraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for this purpose.

# Key Technologies
Python: Core language for scripting and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Requests: To interact with the API and fetch data.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration.
